Snake
=====

A classic arcade game. The objective of the game is to consume as many fruits (![Banana](https://github.com/calvinchengcc/Snake/blob/master/Banana.png), ![Blueberry](https://github.com/calvinchengcc/Snake/blob/master/Blueberry.png), ![Orange](https://github.com/calvinchengcc/Snake/blob/master/Orange.png), ![Strawberry](https://github.com/calvinchengcc/Snake/blob/master/Strawberry.png)) as possible. The longer the snake, the better! Keep in mind, however, that the more the snake eats, the faster it can move. Also, after a certain point, walls appear around the snake as humans attempt to control it. Try not to run into the sides!
